File Descriptions
1_Data_set_construction.py
Constructs Dataset A and extracts features, saving them in the folder "PCSCN_Training_Data" under the "Array" directory.

2_Quality_assessment_model.py
Loads the locally saved feature data, trains the PCSCN model, and saves the trained model in the "Model" folder.

3_Data_cleaning.py
Uses PCSCN to clean Dataset B. For comparison, the data is also subjected to denoising and left untreated. The processed data is saved in the "1_Data_Cleaning", "2_Denoising", and "3_Do_Nothing" folders under the "Array" directory, representing the three different processing methods.

4_Heart_sound_classification_model.py
Trains publicly available models to verify which data processing method is the most effective.

NN.py
Contains the code for the PCSCN model as well as the code for five publicly available models.
Folder Descriptions

Folder "Array"
Stores the processed data locally so that it can be loaded for model training without the need for reprocessing each time. The folder requires a significant amount of local storage space (50GB). 

Folder "Dataset"
Contains the datasets. Dataset A and Dataset B (Dataset B is not provided due to privacy agreements and should be replaced with your own data).

Folder "Model"
Used to save the trained PCSCN models.

PS: It is recommended that readers fold all the contents in "if(0)" when reading the code for the first time. This indicates that it is a code block that implements a specific function. This helps readers understand the macroscopic structure of the code

"1_Data_set_construction.py" and "2_Quality_assessment_model.py" correspond to the original process 1, that is, the training process of PCSCN
"3_Data_cleaning.py" and "4_Heart_sound_classification_model.py" correspond to Process 2 of the original text, namely the control experiment
